# shared25

Shared class repository for trying out git.

Instructions in a nutshell:
- Add code under the function in your section's *.py* file under your "secret" phrase name.
- Add a text file in your section's folder as *mXXXXXX.txt* using your alpha.
- Run the trifecta: git add, git commit, git push
